LeadIn - WordPress CRM

== Description ==

LeadIn is an easy-to-use CRM plugin for WordPress that helps you better understand your web site visitors as individual people.

LeadIn automatically sends you a detailed email report whenever a visitor fills out a form on your website. Each email report includes where the visitor came from, what pages she viewed, social profile links and more.

All of this data is also stored and viewable in one place in the WordPress admin backend.

Setup is easy â€” all you have to do is install the plugin, set an email address for where to send your leads, and you're done.
